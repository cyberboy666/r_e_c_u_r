# r_e_c_u_r
 an open diy py/pi based video sampler

## details

(coming soon)

## main objectives:

- *Affordable* : reducing the entry cost to performing with video
- *Extendable* : laying the foundations (of a user interface and code style) that can be easily iterated on by the community
- *Simple* : easy to operate (abstracted completely from ‘driving’ a raspi ) , easy to build (no technical computer install-y or circuit-y knowledge required to diy) , easy to develop (human readable code, inviting amatuer/first time coders to contribute)

## documentation (coming soon):

- *operating* - how to use r_e_c_u_r
- *building* - how to build r_e_c_u_r
- *developing* - how to contribute to r_e_c_u_r
