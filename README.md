This is doctea's experimental development 'plugins' branch, including 'shader gadget' plugins+more.

Started adding some documentation for some of these features on the wiki here:
* https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r/wiki/Sound-reactivity
* https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r/wiki/using-the-modulation-parameters
* https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r/wiki/Plugins

doctea's experimental branch, implementing enhanced MIDI/actions, APC Key 25 MIDI feedback, and a plugin system with some demo plugins to store/recall shader presets, record/playback shader parameter automation and enable sound reactivity via OSC.

Some quick notes, including about how the modulation features work:-

* Plugins are python classes... With adaptations to recur main code to look up actions in plugins of ActionPlugin class, so plugins can provide extra actions that can be mapped to midi/keyboard/osc
* Here's the really primitive soundreact app: https://github.com/doctea/r_e_c_u_r/blob/feature_midi_feedback_plugin/helpers/soundreact.py
* All it does is send OSC messages based on the volume (the threshold stuff doesn't work and isn't actually activated)
* So then if you look in https://github.com/doctea/r_e_c_u_r/blob/feature_midi_feedback_plugin/json_objects/osc_action_mapping.json you'll see that the "/volume" osc address is bound to the set_modulation_...._value action
* So that way the modulation value is set for 'mod slot 1' to the volume value
* Then when recur is sending paramwter values to the conjur side, it calculates the value to send based on the mod slot level (changed using set_modulation..._level actions mapped in midi APC key25 JSON) and mod slot values
* So there's 4 modulation parameters and you can assign them, with level, to any of the shader parameters as desired, and feed in params from any source into each mod slot
* At moment there's 3 types of plugin which can also be combined: midifeedback for showing leds etc on controllers that support it like APC Key 25 and Launchpad to indicate recur status, actions for adding new actions, and sequences for running short or looped sequences and adjusting speed etc
* Demo useful plugins are here in this shader gadgets branch, demonstrating shader presets and automation recording

# r_e_c_u_r

 an open diy video sampler
 
 ![vectorfront][vectorfront]
 
__r_e_c_u_r__ is an embedded python/openframeworks application on _raspberry pi3_ that uses `input` from the _keypad_ to control  `video` while displaying a simple text ui on a _rpi lcd screen_ 

## in-depth video demo

[![video-walkthrough][video-thumbnail]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKKDr7pLpp0)

## features

- seamlessly loop video through rpi's HDMI or composite out
- intuitively _browse_ video files from external and internal disk and map them into __r_e_c_u_r__
- load and trigger video samples from numbered slots in the _sampler_ bank
- dynamically set and clear the start/end points of each sample as it plays
- control and sequence all inputs and more with midi-usb
- many sampler modes for varied playback including: repeat, one-shot, gated, random, fixed-length, random-start and more 
- exhaustive and extendable _settings_ menu  to suit your use

## extensions

as of _V2.0_ the __r_e_c_u_r__ platform has been extended in a number of directions to complement live performance and  _\_recur\__ , the original video playing engine:

- _\_captur\__ : input live video via CSI or USB , for live sampling and processing
- _\_conjur\__ : glsl shader engine, map and trigger shader files and control parameters in real time; generate video or process and mix existing sources
- _\_detour\__ : in-memory frame sampling (up to 500 frames), video scrubbing, playback speed and direction control, finger drumming
- toggling internal feedback + strobe effect 

_NOTE: most of the new V2.0 features are optimised for sd composite video output. Some of these extensions will work over HDMI but they are not fully supported - especially the live video input struggles_

## main objectives:

- *Affordable* : reducing the entry cost to performing with video
- *Extendable* : laying the foundations (of a user interface and code style) that can be easily iterated on by the community
- *Simple* : easy to operate (abstracted completely from ‘driving’ a raspi ) , easy to build (no technical computer install-y or circuit-y knowledge required to diy) , easy to develop (human readable code, inviting amateur/first time coders to contribute)

## documentation:

- [operating] - how to use r_e_c_u_r
- [building] - how to diy r_e_c_u_r
- [developing] - how to contribute to r_e_c_u_r

many other things documented on the [wiki]

## status

The nature of this project is to be open-ended and community driven. my r_e_c_u_r already solves the problems i initially built it for. what happens next depends on how it is used and received by you. if you like the idea please let me know / get involved !
