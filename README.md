# r_e_c_u_r

 an open diy video sampler
 
 ![vectorfront][vectorfront]
 
__r_e_c_u_r__ is an embedded python/openframeworks application on _raspberry pi3_ that uses `input` from the _keypad_ to control  `video` while displaying a simple text ui on a _rpi lcd screen_ 

## in-depth video demo

## features

- seamlessly loop video through rpi's HDMI or composite out
- intuitively _browse_ video files from external and internal disk and map them into __r_e_c_u_r__
- load and trigger video samples from numbered slots in the _sampler_ bank
- dynamically set and clear the start/end points of each sample as it plays
- control and sequence all inputs and more with midi-usb
- many sampler modes for varied playback including: repeat, one-shot, gated, random, fixed-length, random-start and more 
- exhaustive and extendable _settings_ menu  to suit your use

## extensions

as of _V2.0_ the __r_e_c_u_r__ platform has been extended in a number of directions to complement live performance and  _\_recur\__ , the original video playing engine:

- _\_captur\__ : input live video via CSI or USB , for live sampling and processing
- _\_conjur\__ : glsl shader engine, map and trigger shader files and control parameters in real time; generate video or process and mix existing sources
- _\_detour\__ : in-memory frame sampling (up to 500 frames), video scrubbing, playback speed and direction control, finger drumming
- toggling internal feedback + strobe effect 

_NOTE: most of the new V2.0 features are optimised for sd composite video output. Some of these extensions will work over HDMI but they are not fully supported - especially the live video input struggles_

## main objectives:

- *Affordable* : reducing the entry cost to performing with video
- *Extendable* : laying the foundations (of a user interface and code style) that can be easily iterated on by the community
- *Simple* : easy to operate (abstracted completely from ‘driving’ a raspi ) , easy to build (no technical computer install-y or circuit-y knowledge required to diy) , easy to develop (human readable code, inviting amateur/first time coders to contribute)

## status

The nature of this project is to be open-ended and community driven. my r_e_c_u_r already solves the problems i initially built it for. what happens next depends on how it is used and received by you. if you like the idea please let me know / get involved !
