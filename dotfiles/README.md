# documenting the exact steps to creating the r_e_c_u_r raspbian image

## initial set up ; flashing fresh sd, keyboard , wifi , updates etcs

- downloaded the latest (~~2017-11-29~~ ~~2018-04-18~~ [2019-07-10]) raspbian-raspbian-lite image from offical site.

- flashed it to my sd using etcher

- set up auto console login and changed keyboard layout using `sudo raspi-config`

- following the beginning of [this](https://gist.github.com/kmpm/8e535a12a45a32f6d36cf26c7c6cef51) guide,
set up wifi and run all updates: 

`sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` Add the bottom of the file
```
network={
  ssid="YOUR_SSID"
  psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

then `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` , sudo reboot

- i trieds to get this working without needing pixel installed (using openbox and a few other bits but the drivers for my screens didnt work like this - decided its not worth shaving that yak rn. will proceed with a stripped pixel as described above:
 
## download/install pixel + all dependencies for r_e_c_u_r : 
 ```
 sudo apt-get install -y raspberrypi-ui-mods git python3-tk omxplayer libdbus-glib-1-dev python3-pip unclutter python3-picamera gpac 
 
 pip3 install dbus-python omxplayer-wrapper  mido python-rtmidi
 ```

- now can set up auto desktop login using `sudo raspi-config`

## download the code in this repo:

- pull down recur code into home dir ~ : `git clone https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r.git`

## quiet x and run my launcher script on boot:

- used ~~sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart~~ `sudo nano/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart` to add these lines : 
```
@unclutter -display :0 -idle 0 -root -noevents
@xset s off
@xset s noblank
@xset -dpms
@bash /home/pi/r_e_c_u_r/dotfiles/launcher.sh
```

and remove the line `@point-rpi` 

these are suppose to stop screensaver / hide cursor / remove on screen power warnings etc

- i then went into pi item -> Preferences and set a black background , small task bar , no screensaver  and went into the file explorer -> Edit -> Preferences -> Volume Managment -> unchecked 'show available options for removable media ...' and made taskbar auto hide...

- created internal storage folder in ~/Videos 

- set a custom splash screen by replacing splash.png an image at:
`sudo cp ~/r_e_c_u_r/documentation/splash.png /usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png`
 
## for piCaptureSd1

need to install : `sudo apt-get install python3-smbus` and `sudo pip3 install pivideo`

## lcd display drivers

these are the drivers for the waveshare displays that work on the cheep lcd i ordered online ( [LCD-show-170703] ).~~

`git clone https://github.com/waveshare/LCD-show`

my screen only needs the LCD35-show-180 and LCD-hdmi scripts. after running both of these scripts the drivers can be deleted since the recur code then handles the switching. (or keep em if you wanna flip the screen or try calibrating the touch screen)


## installing raspi2fb

i decided to use AndrewFromMelbourne's [raspi2fb] to get a approx of output on the lcd screen. following their readme i installed :

`sudo apt-get install cmake libbsd-dev`

 pulled down the code from home dir  `git clone https://github.com/AndrewFromMelbourne/raspi2fb.git` 
 
 moved into the folder then ran the following commands : 
 ```
 mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo cp ../raspi2fb@.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable raspi2fb@1.service
```
a line to Popen inside the python code toggles this on and off from here.

## lines added to config.txt

the fastest way is to copy the config.txt i included in the repo:

`sudo cp ~/r_e_c_u_r/dotfiles/config.txt /boot/config.txt`

be careful though - messing with the config.txt is the easiest way to brick the image from my experience ... 

or do these :

- commenting out hdmi_force to allow composite output: `#hdmi_force_hotplug=1`

- add these lines to the config:
```
## gives more memory to the gpu for playing 1080 videos (might need to adjust this when using older pis with less memory)
gpu_mem_256=120
gpu_mem_512=200
gpu_mem_1024=448
gpu_mem=600
## enables the raspi camera
start_x=1
## fixes bug with playback freezing
audio_pwm_mode=0

## persisting composite settings
sdtv_mode=00
sdtv_aspect=1

## switch for enabling lcd screen (the next line is being used even if its commented out)
##no_waveshare_overlay
```

## changes to the cmdline.txt

add to end of cmdline.txt `sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt` : 
`quiet splash logo.nologo plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles` for quiet boot with splash screen 


## installing openframeworks and setting up conjur app

`wget "https://openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.10.1/of_v0.10.1_linuxarmv6l_release.tar.gz"`

- `mkdir openFrameworks` and `tar vxfz of_v0.10.1_linuxarmv6l_release.tar.gz -C openFrameworks --strip-components 1`
- `cd openFrameworks/scripts/linux/debian/` &  `sudo ./install_dependencies.sh`
- `make Release -C ~/openFrameworks/libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project`
- `cd ~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/` and `git clone https://github.com/langolierz/c_o_n_j_u_r`
- `cd ~/openFrameworks/addons/` and `git clone https://github.com/langolierz/ofxOMXCamera.git` (will swap this out for main once/if my edits work and get in)
- `git clone https://github.com/langolierz/ofxVideoArtTools`
- `git clone https://github.com/timscaffidi/ofxVideoRecorder` and its depend : `sudo apt-get install ffmeg` 
- `git clone https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer` and install depends : `cd ofxOMXPlayer; ./install_depends.sh` and checkout last stable version `git checkout c826828`
- `git clone https://github.com/kashimAstro/ofxGPIO`
- `git clone https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi`
- `git clone https://github.com/jeffcrouse/ofxJSON`
- (install dependances for of ??)
- `make ~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/c_o_n_j_u_r`


## installing packages and apps

- `sudo pip3 install Adafruit_GPIO Adafruit_MCP3008 RPi.GPIO pivideo python-osc` (tried to install threading but didnt work...)
 - (note atleast pivideo needs to be installed with sudo.), also needs `sudo pip3 install serial``
- pip3 install gitpython
- `sudo apt-get install glslviewer`

### installing ttymidi :
- `wget http://www.varal.org/ttymidi/ttymidi.tar.gz` and `tar -zxvf ttymidi.tar.gz`
- `cd ttymidi` and `sudo nano Makefile` then add `-pthread` after -lasound ... 
- then `sudo make` then `sudo make install`

## setup:

need to delete the old settings : `rm json_objects/settings.json` ~~and create a `Shaders` folder, also need to put default.vert shader in there for any shaders to work !~~

i think will need to turn on the i2c and serial interfacing... (and maybe that serial switvhing thing .. oh and the clocking for midi serial ...  )

NOTE: need to disable console logging and enable seial through the raspi-config !

these amount to the following in the config:
```
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=spi=on
enable_uart=1
```
plus this for serial midi : 
```
#setup midi over serial
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
dtoverlay=midi-uart0
```

## updates for v2.2 :

### install AccessPoint switching repo :

- `git clone https://github.com/Autodrop3d/raspiApWlanScripts.git`
- then run the setup script with correct wlan name / password , and the setup for access-point :
`sudo bash raspiApWlanScripts/setup_wlan_and_AP_modes.sh -s <your wifi name> -p <your wifi password> -a r_e_c_u_r -r cyberboy666`
- remove wifi and password from wpa_supplicant.conf since now it reads from wpa_supplicant-wlan.conf ,,

### install and setup node server for remote access/control

- `git clone https://github.com/guergana/r_e_m_o_t_e.git`
- download node `wget https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/node-v10.17.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz`
- extract files `tar -xzf node-v10.17.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz`

Finally copy node to its final location and expose it as a global command:

```
cd node-v6.11.1-linux-armv6l/
sudo cp -R * /usr/local/
```
- noe `cd r_e_m_o_t_e/`
- now install sockets `npm install socket.io --save`
- install node-osc `npm install node-osc --save` (do we need this ?)
- install osc-js `npm install node-osc --save`

### install some plugin packages:

- install serial package : `pip3 install pyserial`
- install pyaudio : `sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio`

# wjhat follows is info, not instructions for setup:

## key mapping and the launcher script:

because the keypad i bought had some special keys (eg numlock) that interact with the others in ways i didnt want , i decided to remap the keys on it to letters a-s in order. to do this i used `xmodmap`:

you can find the current keymappings using `xmodmap -pke` and for the specifically numpad related keymappings use:

    xmodmap -pke | grep KP > defaultKeymap
    xmodmap -pke | grep Nu >> defaultKeymap

which prints only the default numpad keys to a file for reference later.
keys can be manually remapped using `xmodmap -e "keycode 82=a"` for testing.

In order to have the custom keymap work on startup we have added the line `xmodmap ~/r_e_c_u_r/dotfiles/.remap` to the launcher script where the file `.remap` has a list of the keycodes that you want to include.

## exporting image

first remove my wifi password ! (and git profile if present)

`sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
`git config --global user.email ""`
`git config --global user.name ""`

i exported the image using unix command `dd` from the raspberry pi i wanted an image of.

i had some success using [pishrink], following the instructions on readme exactly , i managed to reduce a 3.8gb image down to 2.9gb and then zipped down to 1.15gb, (this would be more useful with larger cards though).

- the flow is using dd to copy the image from the pi to an external drive `sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/pi/FLASH DRIVE/recur.img`

- then use pishrink to reduce this image `sudo pishrink.sh recur.img` it fails the first time but works straight after - not sure why !

i had a `Unexpected Inconsistency` problem with my image which [this link] helped solve.

- then gzip to zip this : `sudo gzip recur.img`
